Create a more engaging experience and connect with more users by integrating social into your Android app.



Required Android API Levels
===========================

We recommend setting your app's *Target Framework* and *Target Android version* to **Android 5.0 (API Level 21)** or higher in your app project settings.

This Google Play Service SDK's requires a *Target Framework* of at least Android 4.1 (API Level 16) to compile.

You may still set a lower *Minimum Android version* (as low as Android 2.3 - API Level 9) so your app will run on older versions of Android, however you must ensure you do not use any API's at runtime that are not available on the version of Android your app is running on.




Google Developers Console Setup
=================================

Many of the Google Play Services SDK's require that you create an application inside the [Google Developers Console][1].  Visit the [Google Developers Console][1] to create a project for your application.

Once you have created a project for your Android app, enable the necessary APIs in the developer console for the Google Play Services APIs you will be using in your app.



You must enable the *Google+ API* API in the Developers Console to be able to use the APIs in your app.



Credentials
-----------

Some Google Play Services APIs require an *API Key* or an *OAuth 2.0 Client ID* (or both) to be setup to allow your app to make authenticated calls against the API.

In the Developers Console, in your app's Project, under the *APIs & auth* section, go to *Credentials*.





### OAuth 2.0 Client ID

This SDK/API requires an OAuth 2.0 Client ID to be created:

  1. *Add credentials* button and then *OAuth 2.0 client ID*
  2. Choose *Android* for the Application type.
  3. [Find your SHA-1 fingerprints][2]
  4. Enter the SHA-1 fingerprint of your app's debug keystore
  5. Enter your android app's package name as found in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file
  6. Check *Enable Deep Linking*
  7. Click *Create*
  8. Repeat this process with the package name and SHA-1 of the keystore file you will be signing your app's Release builds with

NOTE: Once you have created the OAuth 2.0 Client ID, you typically do not need to do anything with the generated *Client ID* value since your keystore SHA-1 fingerprints will identify the client id for you.




Android Manifest 
================

Some Google Play Services APIs require specific metadata, attributes, permissions or features to be declared in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file.

These can be added manually to the *AndroidManifest.xml* file, or merged in through the use of assembly level attributes.


The SDK requires the *Internet*, *GetAccounts* and *UseCredentials* permissions to work correctly.  You can have these automatically added to your *AndroidManifest.xml* file by including the following assembly level attributes:

```csharp
[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.Internet)]
[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.GetAccounts)]
[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.UseCredentials)]
```



Samples
=======

You can find a Sample Application within each Google Play Services component.  The sample will demonstrate the necessary configuration and some basic API usages.
