Visit the [Google Developers Console][1] to create a project for your application.\n\nOnce you have created a project for your Android app, enable the necessary APIs in the developer console for the Google Play Services APIs you will be using in your app.\n\n\n\nYou must enable the *Google+ API* API in the Developers Console to be able to use the APIs in your app.\n\n\n\nCredentials\n-----------\n\nSome Google Play Services APIs require an *API Key* or an *OAuth 2.0 Client ID* (or both) to be setup to allow your app to make authenticated calls against the API.\n\nIn the Developers Console, in your app\u0027s Project, under the *APIs \u0026 auth* section, go to *Credentials*.\n\n\n\n\n\n### OAuth 2.0 Client ID\n\nThis SDK/API requires an OAuth 2.0 Client ID to be created:\n\n  1. *Add credentials* button and then *OAuth 2.0 client ID*\n  2. Choose *Android* for the Application type.\n  3. [Find your SHA-1 fingerprints][2]\n  4. Enter the SHA-1 fingerprint of your app\u0027s debug keystore\n  5. Enter your android app\u0027s package name as found in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file\n  6. Check *Enable Deep Linking*\n  7. Click *Create*\n  8. Repeat this process with the package name and SHA-1 of the keystore file you will be signing your app\u0027s Release builds with\n\nNOTE: Once you have created the OAuth 2.0 Client ID, you typically do not need to do anything with the generated *Client ID* value since your keystore SHA-1 fingerprints will identify the client id for you.\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Manifest \n================\n\nSome Google Play Services APIs require specific metadata, attributes, permissions or features to be declared in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file.\n\nThese can be added manually to the *AndroidManifest.xml* file, or merged in through the use of assembly level attributes.\n\n\nThe SDK requires the *Internet*, *GetAccounts* and *UseCredentials* permissions to work correctly.  You can have these automatically added to your *AndroidManifest.xml* file by including the following assembly level attributes:\n\n```csharp\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.Internet)]\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.GetAccounts)]\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.UseCredentials)]\n```\n\n\n\nSamples\n=======\n\nYou can find a Sample Application within each Google Play Services component.  The sample will demonstrate the necessary configuration and some basic API usages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n==========\n\nYou can learn more about the various Google Play Services SDKs \u0026 APIs by visiting the official [Google APIs for Android][3] documentation\n\n\nYou can learn more about Google Play Services Plus by visiting the official [Plus SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/+/mobile/android/) documentation.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://console.developers.google.com/ \"Google Developers Console\"\n[2]: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/MD5_SHA1/ \"Finding your SHA-1 Fingerprints\"\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/android/ \"Google APIs for Android\"\n\n","Hash":"7e36e511d8c9484aec9eea7b164c3099","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
