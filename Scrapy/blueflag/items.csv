“Eftalou” is the country place of Molyvos. It ,
has been the sea resort of its inhabitants, since ,
the ancient times with a special natural beauty. In ,
Eftalou, someone will also find the hot springs and ,
our healing spas. In Eftalou, there are also ,
situated the country houses (koules) of spiritual ,
people of Greece, like Argiris Eftaliotis, who came ,
from Mithymna (he took his pseudonym from the ,
place of Eftalou) and Ilias Venezis. Eftalou ,
preserves the authenticity of its landscape, as it is ,
a lightly structured area with a few big hotels and ,
small tourist housings, in a small distance from the ,
coasts. Eftalou coasts have small grey stones ,
and they are fully planted by heaths. Eftalou ,
coasts have also fringes, upon which they lie lot of ,
stubbles, sea violets, bushes and yellow ,
amaranths, depending on the season. In addition, ,
the hills that surround these coasts are fully ,
planted by olive-trees, pine-trees and gardens. ,
By the sea, there are also rocky large stones with ,
elaborate designs, that stand there for centuries ,
and they make up admirable geological ,
monuments. The sea-shores of Eftalou are an ,
elective choice for lots of visitors, as well as for ,
locals, who consciously reject the so-,
called “plastic convenience”. The contact with the ,
esthetic of the landscape, the nature and the ,
sparkling water in Eftalou, is a unique ,
experience. The renting of the coasts to ,
individuals is not allowed. Thus, it is not possible ,
there for anyone to view plastic chairs, ,
antiaesthetic umbrellas or water sports. As far ,
as the services of the swimmers are concerned - ,
who in their majority belong to the admirers of ,
nature and natural environment - there are only the ,
absolutely necessary substructions, such as ,
distinctive information tables, toilets, showers as ,
well as distinctive dressing rooms. Access to ,
the beginning of the sea-shores, can also be ,
succeeded by car, since the road till a certain point ,
is asphalt. However, just before the healing spas ,
of Eftalou and the main coast of Saint-Anargiri, ,
visitors can only walk. The distance though, from ,
the point the car stops does not exceed the 400 ,

“Eftalou” is the country place of Molyvos. It ,
has been the sea resort of its inhabitants, since ,
the ancient times with a special natural beauty. In ,
Eftalou, someone will also find the hot springs and ,
our healing spas. In Eftalou, there are also ,
situated the country houses (koules) of spiritual ,
people of Greece, like Argiris Eftaliotis, who came ,
from Mithymna (he took his pseudonym from the ,
place of Eftalou) and Ilias Venezis. Eftalou ,
preserves the authenticity of its landscape, as it is ,
a lightly structured area with a few big hotels and ,
small tourist housings, in a small distance from the ,
coasts. Eftalou coasts have small grey stones ,
and they are fully planted by heaths. Eftalou ,
coasts have also fringes, upon which they lie lot of ,
stubbles, sea violets, bushes and yellow ,
amaranths, depending on the season. In addition, ,
the hills that surround these coasts are fully ,
planted by olive-trees, pine-trees and gardens. ,
By the sea, there are also rocky large stones with ,
elaborate designs, that stand there for centuries ,
and they make up admirable geological ,
monuments. The sea-shores of Eftalou are an ,
elective choice for lots of visitors, as well as for ,
locals, who consciously reject the so-,
called “plastic convenience”. The contact with the ,
esthetic of the landscape, the nature and the ,
sparkling water in Eftalou, is a unique ,
experience. The renting of the coasts to ,
individuals is not allowed. Thus, it is not possible ,
there for anyone to view plastic chairs, ,
antiaesthetic umbrellas or water sports. As far ,
as the services of the swimmers are concerned - ,
who in their majority belong to the admirers of ,
nature and natural environment - there are only the ,
absolutely necessary substructions, such as ,
distinctive information tables, toilets, showers as ,
well as distinctive dressing rooms. Access to ,
the beginning of the sea-shores, can also be ,
succeeded by car, since the road till a certain point ,
is asphalt. However, just before the healing spas ,
of Eftalou and the main coast of Saint-Anargiri, ,
visitors can only walk. The distance though, from ,
the point the car stops does not exceed the 400 ,
metres. The length of the central coast of ,
Saint-Anargiri is about 600M and its width is 60M.",Lesvos,EftalouAg.Anargyroi,"Eftalou /Ag. Anargyroi, Beach located in Lesvos"

ecologically sensitive areas as they are the,
meeting point of land and sea. An ecosystem of,
special characteristics develops in these,
conditions. Sand dunes are an important ecological,
beach element and presently they are protected,
by E. U regulations due to their importance to,
ecology. Sand dunes host many,
kinds of plant and animal life perfectly adapted to,
the special climatological and ecological beach,
environment. Sand dunes also protect the beach,
from erosion. In the past beach sand,
dunes were very common. Nowadays they are,
almost vanished. Therefore the areas that still,
sustain sand dunes in good condition are equipped,
with significant ecological wealth and they are,
obliged to protect them also for the,
future.KAMARES LAKE Kamares beach has up to,

“Eftalou” is the country place of Molyvos. It ,
has been the sea resort of its inhabitants, since ,
the ancient times with a special natural beauty. In ,
Eftalou, someone will also find the hot springs and ,
our healing spas. In Eftalou, there are also ,
situated the country houses (koules) of spiritual ,
people of Greece, like Argiris Eftaliotis, who came ,
from Mithymna (he took his pseudonym from the ,
place of Eftalou) and Ilias Venezis. Eftalou ,
preserves the authenticity of its landscape, as it is ,
a lightly structured area with a few big hotels and ,
small tourist housings, in a small distance from the ,
coasts. Eftalou coasts have small grey stones ,
and they are fully planted by heaths. Eftalou ,
coasts have also fringes, upon which they lie lot of ,
stubbles, sea violets, bushes and yellow ,
amaranths, depending on the season. In addition, ,
the hills that surround these coasts are fully ,
planted by olive-trees, pine-trees and gardens. ,
By the sea, there are also rocky large stones with ,
elaborate designs, that stand there for centuries ,
and they make up admirable geological ,
monuments. The sea-shores of Eftalou are an ,
elective choice for lots of visitors, as well as for ,
locals, who consciously reject the so-,
called “plastic convenience”. The contact with the ,
esthetic of the landscape, the nature and the ,
sparkling water in Eftalou, is a unique ,
experience. The renting of the coasts to ,
individuals is not allowed. Thus, it is not possible ,
there for anyone to view plastic chairs, ,
antiaesthetic umbrellas or water sports. As far ,
as the services of the swimmers are concerned - ,
who in their majority belong to the admirers of ,
nature and natural environment - there are only the ,
absolutely necessary substructions, such as ,
distinctive information tables, toilets, showers as ,
well as distinctive dressing rooms. Access to ,
the beginning of the sea-shores, can also be ,
succeeded by car, since the road till a certain point ,
is asphalt. However, just before the healing spas ,
of Eftalou and the main coast of Saint-Anargiri, ,
visitors can only walk. The distance though, from ,
the point the car stops does not exceed the 400 ,
metres. The length of the central coast of ,
Saint-Anargiri is about 600M and its width is 60M.",,"Eftalou /Ag. Anargyroi, Beach located in Lesvos",,EftalouAg.Anargyroi,Lesvos
